this project appears to use cloud services indirectly. Let me explain:

Google Translate API:

The project relies on Google Translate API for performing language translations. This is a cloud-based service provided by Google that processes text inputs and returns the translated text in the target language.
The API is called in the script.js file through the https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2 endpoint, which processes data in real-time over the internet.
Third-party Libraries:

The project also uses a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to load the Ionicons library. This library provides icons and is fetched via cloud-hosted URLs (https://unpkg.com/ionicons). This demonstrates another form of cloud usage for asset delivery.
File Upload Handling:

If implemented fully, the input[type="file"] element in the project could potentially integrate with a cloud storage service to handle uploaded files for translation. While it's not fully implemented in the code you shared, such functionality would commonly involve cloud storage for file handling.
What Does Cloud Bring to This Project?
The cloud services enable:

Translation Logic: Powered by Google's infrastructure.
Scalability: Real-time translation and processing for a wide range of users.
Icon and Style Hosting: Lightens the server load and improves accessibility.
Without cloud integration, achieving such functionality would require building extensive infrastructure and processing power locally, which is less practical for such applications.
